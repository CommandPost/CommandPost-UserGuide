# CommandPost User Guide

Welcome to the CommandPost User Guide.

CommandPost is a **free** and **open source** Mac application that adds a mountain-load of new features to Apple’s [Final Cut Pro](http://apple.com/final-cut-pro/). It originally started off as a little proof of concept project to make finding the browser playhead easier for [Scott Simmons](http://www.scottsimmons.tv/) \(you can read the origin story [here](https://latenitefilms.com/blog/final-cut-pro-hacks/)\) – but has since grown into a huge collection of handy professional workflow tools and automation features to make editing within Final Cut Pro faster, easier and much more powerful.

We hope you enjoy reading this user guide. If you have any comments, ideas or suggestions of how it could be improved, please don't hesitate to [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost-UserGuide/issues).
