**PLEASE NOTE:** This next setup screen has been removed in Beta 22 and later. However, you can still enable "Control CommandPost Shortcuts within Final Cut Pro" via the Final Cut Pro Preferences window.

The next setup screen asks you whether you wish to use Final Cut Pro's Command Editor to control it's shortcuts, or the built-in CommandPost Shortcut Manager, which is found in the Shortcuts tab in CommandPost's Preferences.

If you select **USE FINAL CUT PRO**, you'll be asked for your Administrator password. Once done, CommandPost will add all it's own shortcuts (for example, "Enable Scrolling Timeline") to Final Cut Pro's own Command Editor for easy access.

If you select **USE COMMANDPOST**, then you can setup your CommandPost shortcuts via the Shortcuts tab in CommandPost's Preferences.

Clicking either option will bring you to the final screen:
