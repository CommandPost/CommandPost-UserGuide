# Shared Clipboard
---

This feature is off by default and must be activated by clicking "Enable Shared Clipboard" from the CommandPost menu.

When you click "Enable Shared Clipboard" you will be prompted to select a folder in which youâ€™ll save your shared clipboard.

This should be a network drive, or cloud storage such as iCloud or Dropbox, so multiple editors can access the shared clipboard at the same time.

Once enabled, when you copy anything in Final Cut Pro it will automatically appear on all of your machines that are running CommandPost and pointing to the same Shared Clipboard folder.

This makes sharing assets between machines as easy as copying and pasting!
